PS: Doesn't look great because everything is crammed, was one of my CSS learning projects. It's actually scaled much differently, it all looks very wide but that is because it would be placed over an XenForo forum container which is already scaled, and because XenForo allows embedded HTML pages, I designed this in this way because it wasn't really worth resizing anything if XenForo was going to scale it anyway.
